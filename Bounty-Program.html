        <h4>Bounty payment</h4>
        <p>Payment is made only in Unilot.io tokens – UNILOT</p>
        <p>Bounty program’s results, including the calculation of tokens earned, will be announced within one week after
            the token launch end date and time.</p>
        <p>Each member's amount of bounty UNILOT tokens will be calculated using the following formula below.</p>
        <p><b><i>(Total amount of bounty campaign UNILOT tokens / Total amount of bounty campaign participants' stakes)
            * Member's stakes</i></b></p>
        <p>For example, the distribution of tokens in the signature campaign:</p>
        <p><i>(Total amount of signature campaign UNILOT tokens / Total amount of bounty signature campaign
            participants' stakes) * Member's stakes</i></p>
