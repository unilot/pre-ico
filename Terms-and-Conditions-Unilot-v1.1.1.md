7.2 The purchase of UNIT Tokens shall be initiated by the Purchaser by transferring an amount in Ether from their whitelisted address during the Purchase Period to the Smart Contract System at the address to be published on the Unilot website when the Purchase Period commences. The Smart Contract System will allocate UNIT Tokens to Purchasers as set forth herein to the whitelisted Ethereum wallet address from which the contribution was received.

Unless expressly set forth in these T&Cs or the Unilot Website, any and all third-party websites, services and/or smart-contract offering to receive contributions and issue UNIT Tokens or facilitate the allocation or transfer of UNIT Tokens in any way during the Purchase Period, are not authorised by Unilot and do not have any legal or commercial relationship in any way with Unilot, the Unilot Platform or UNIT Tokens.

risks losing its entire contribution and Unilot shall not be responsible or liable for recovering or returning any such contributions to such Purchaser nor shall Unilot be responsible or liable in any way for any losses incurred by such Purchaser as a result of such erroneous contributions.

In other words, the Purchaser’s Ethereum wallet must possess technical infrastructure that is compatible with the receipt, storage and transfer of UNIT Tokens, being tokens that are created based on the ERC20 token standard. Compatible wallets include: Metamask, MIST, or the Gnosis multi-sig wallet. UNIT Tokens may not be issued to any Purchaser sending ETH from exchanges. We reserve a right to prescribe additional conditions relating to the specific wallet requirements at any time, in our sole and absolute discretion. UNIT Tokens can be Purchased solely by following the procedures set forth in these T&Cs and the Unilot Website.

7.6 Subject to compliance with the foregoing provisions of clause 5 above and this clause 6 and all other relevant terms set forth in these T&Cs, delivery of UNIT Tokens shall be made by us within one calendar week following the end of the Purchase Period by sending UNIT Tokens to the Ethereum wallet address from which your contribution was received.

Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “**Disputes**”) in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Unilot (i) waive your and Unilot’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these T&Cs resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your and Unilot’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Unilot will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

19.2 No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. Any Dispute arising out of or related to these T&Cs is personal to you and Unilot and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

19.3 Arbitration Rules. The enforceability of this clause 19 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the rules of The International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“**ICDR**”) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

19.4 Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve such Dispute informally. Notice to Unilot shall be sent by e-mail to Unilot at notices@url. Notice to you shall be sent to any address you provide to us in a written notice. Your notice must include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute and (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Unilot cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date the notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or Unilot may, as appropriate and in accordance with this clause 19, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in clause 19.1, file a claim in court.

19.5 Process. Any arbitration will occur in Malta. The arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator appointed by the ICDR in accordance with the rules of the ICDR, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The courts located in Malta will have exclusive jurisdiction over any permissible court proceedings, which are intended to include only appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration decision.

19.6 Authority of Arbitrator. These T&Cs, the applicable ICDR rules and the arbitrator will have: (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative or class action, which is prohibited by these T&Cs. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

19.7 Arbitration Rules. The rules of the ICDR and additional information about The International Centre for Dispute Resolution are available at https://www.icdr.org/icdr/faces/home. By agreeing to be bound by these T&Cs, you either (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the ICDR rules, or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the ICDR rules and any claim that the ICDR are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

19.8 Severability of Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provisions. If any term, clause or provision of this clause 19 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent applicable and required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this clause 19 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in clause 19.2 above are severable from the other provisions of these T&Cs and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.

## 20. Miscellaneous
20.1 The Purchaser understands and accepts that the network of miners will ultimately be in control of the Smart Contract System and that a majority of these miners could agree at any point to make changes to the official Smart Contract System and to run a new version of the Smart Contract System. Such a scenario could lead to UNIT Tokens losing all or part of their value.

20.2 We reserve the right to make non-material changes to these Terms and Conditions, including the changes required to reflect the changes to the intended functionality of UNIT Tokens or as may be otherwise required by any laws or regulatory requirements to which we are or may be subject to at any time. With respect to any material amendments to these T&Cs, we will publish a notice together with the updated T&Cs on the Unilot Website and we will change the “Last Updated” date, we will give you prior notice and/or to obtain your prior consent before making such changes and your continued use of the Unilot website and Unit Tokens will be deemed to be your acceptance of such material changes. It is your responsibility to regularly check the Unilot Website for any such notices and updated T&Cs. 

20.3 If any term, clause or provision of these T&Cs is found to be illegal, void or unenforceable (in whole or in part), then such term, clause or provision shall be severable from these T&Cs without affecting the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these T&Cs, which shall remain in full force and effect.

20.4 These T&Cs constitute the entire agreement between the Parties in relation to its subject matter. These T&Cs replace and extinguish any and all prior agreements, draft agreements, arrangements, warranties, statements, assurances, representations and undertakings of any nature made by, or on behalf of the Parties, whether oral or written, public or private, in relation to that subject matter.

20.5 In the event that any provision of this Terms and Conditions is deemed by any competent authority to be unenforceable or invalid, the relevant provision shall be modified to allow it to be enforced in line with the intention of the original text to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected.

20.6 You acknowledge that by accepting these T&Cs, you have not relied on any oral or written statements, warranties, assurances, representations or undertakings which were or may have been made by or on behalf of Unilot in relation to the subject matter of these T&Cs at any time before your acceptance of them (“**Pre-Contractual Statements**”), other than those set out in these T&Cs. You hereby waive any and all rights and remedies which might otherwise be available in relation to such Pre-Contractual Statements.

20.7 Nothing in these T&Cs shall be deemed to create any form of partnership, joint venture or any other similar relationship between you and Unilot and/or other individuals or entities involved with the development and deployment of the Smart Contract System and/or the Unilot Platform.

20.8 Subject to clause 19, these T&Cs and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes and claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Malta law.

20.9 In the event of a fork in the Ethereum network, Unilot maintains sole discretion as to which Ethereum fork(s) it will serve.

# SCHEDULE 1
## INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF UNIT TOKENS
UNIT Tokens are not intended to have any functionality or utility outside the Unilot Platform. The Unilot Platform will therefore be structured as a “closed system” insofar as the use of UNIT Tokens is concerned.

## UNIT TOKEN CREATION AND INTENDED DISTRIBUTION
A total of 10,000,000 UNIT Tokens will be created and no additional UNIT Tokens will be created in the future. A minimum of 796,296 and a maximum of 5,000,000 UNIT Tokens will be sold during the Token Sale and the remaining UNIT Tokens shall be allocated as follows:
* 2,000,000 UNIT Tokens will allocated to the founders of Unilot;
* 3,000,000 UNIT Tokens will be retained by Unilot for use in marketing and business development activities; and
* Any UNIT Token not sold during the Token Sale (i.e. a Completion Condition is met prior to all 5,000,000 UNIT allocated to the Token Sale being sold) shall remain at the disposal of Unilot to be used and/or distributed for any purposes in our sole and absolute discretion.

# SCHEDULE 3
## RISK FACTORS
1. Risk of software weaknesses: because UNIT Tokens, the Smart Contract System and the Unilot Platform are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on UNIT Tokens, the Smart Contract System and/or the Unilot Platform. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the UNIT Tokens, the Smart Contract System and/or the Unilot Platform, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol. The Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven. There is no warranty or assurance that the process for creating UNIT Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, viruses or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of contributions and/or UNIT Tokens.

2. Regulatory risk: blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Smart Contract System and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications to the Smart Contract System and/or the Unilot Platform, including its termination and the loss of UNIT Tokens for the Purchaser. Additionally, regulation of proposed activities of the Unilot Platform is currently uncertain. It is not known what regulatory framework the proposed Unilot Platform and associated activities will be subject to, the nature of the obligations that will be imposed on Unilot in order to comply with any such regulatory framework or when or if Unilot will even be able to apply to be regulated, or successfully obtain the necessary licences so that it may lawfully carry out its proposed business activities in all relevant jurisdictions. 

3. Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions: the regulatory status of UNIT Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Unilot Platform and UNIT Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any legislative or regulatory authorities may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Unilot Platform and UNIT Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Unilot Platform and UNIT Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that UNIT Tokens are a regulated financial instrument that requires registration or licensing. Unilot may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

4. Risk of abandonment / lack of success: the creation and issue of UNIT Tokens and the development of the Unilot Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). There is no assurance that, even if the Unilot Platform is partially or fully developed and launched, you will receive any benefits through UNIT Tokens that you hold.

5. Risk associated with other applications: the Unilot Platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which UNIT Tokens will likely not be usable.

6. Risks associated with markets for UNIT Tokens: We do not enable or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of UNIT Tokens. This may restrict the contemplated avenues for using UNIT Tokens, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to any UNIT Tokens you own. Even if secondary trading of UNIT Tokens is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that any third party ascribes an external exchange value to UNIT Tokens (e.g. as denominated in a crypto or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. If you are purchasing UNIT Tokens as a form of investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, or for a financial purpose, with the expectation or desire that their inherent, intrinsic or cash-equivalent value may increase with time, you assume all risks associated with such speculation or actions, and any errors associated therewith, and accept that UNIT Tokens are not offered by Unilot or our affiliates on an investment basis. You further acknowledge that any contribution that you make under these T&Cs will not be protected, guaranteed or reimbursed by any governmental, regulatory or other entity, and will not, for instance be guaranteed by the Malta Deposit Guarantee Scheme, the Malta Investor Compensation Scheme, and is unlikely to be protected by any equivalent scheme in a jurisdiction outside of Malta.

7. Risk of losing access to tokens due to loss of private key(s), custodial error or your error: UNIT Tokens can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet with a combination of the Purchaser’s account information (address), private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. You acknowledge, understand and accept that if your private key or password gets lost or stolen, the obtained UNIT Tokens associated with your Ethereum wallet address may be unrecoverable and permanently lost. Additionally, any third party that gains access to your private key, including by gaining access to the login credentials relating to your Ethereum wallet, may be able to misappropriate your UNIT Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault in which you choose to receive and store UNIT Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your UNIT Tokens.

8. Risk of theft: the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Any such successful attacks could result in theft or loss of contributions or UNIT Tokens, adversely impacting the ability to develop the Unilot Platform and derive any usage or functionality from UNIT Tokens. Furthermore, because the Unilot Platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Unilot team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or defects into the core infrastructure of the Unilot Platform, which could negatively affect the Unilot Platform and UNIT Tokens.

9. Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart Contract System is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and rare condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract System, expected proper execution and sequencing of token transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. You understand and accept that the network of miners will ultimately be in control of the delivery of the UNIT Tokens via the Smart Contract System, and that a majority of miners could agree at any point to make changes, updates, modifications to, or effect a deletion or destruction of the Smart Contract System, and that such a scenario could lead to the UNIT Tokens losing intrinsic value and/or functionality.

10. Risk of incompatible wallet service: the wallet or wallet service provider used to receive UNIT Tokens must conform to the ERC20 token standard in order to be technically compatible with UNIT Tokens. The failure to ensure such conformity may have the result that Purchaser will not gain access to his UNIT Tokens.

11. Risk of hard-fork: the Unilot Platform will need to go through substantial development works as part of which it may become the subject of significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. As part of the development, an upgrade to UNIT Tokens may be required (hard-fork of UNIT Tokens) and that, if you decide not to participate in such upgrade, you may no longer be able to use your UNIT Tokens and any non-upgraded UNIT Tokens may lose all or part of their functionality.

12. Risk of uninsured losses: unlike bank accounts or accounts at other financial institutions, UNIT Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us to offer recourse to you.

13. Risks arising from taxation: the tax characterization of UNIT Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with acquisition, storage, transfer and use of UNIT Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements.

14. Risk of an unfavourable fluctuation of Ethereum and other currency value: Unilot intends to use the contributions received to fund the development of the Unilot Platform and various other operating expenses. The contributions received will be denominated in ETH, and may be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of ETH or other such currencies fluctuate unfavourably during or after the Purchase Period, Unilot may not be able to fund the development of, or may not be able to maintain, the Unilot Platform in the manner that it intended, in which case the UNIT Tokens may lose all or part of their value.

15. Risk of dissolution of the Company or network: it is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of ETH (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in UNIT Tokens utility due to negative adoption of the Unilot Platform, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Unilot Platform may no longer be viable to operate and Unilot may dissolve.

16. Risks arising from lack of governance rights: because UNIT Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Unilot Platform or Unilot, all decisions involving the Unilot Platform or Unilot will be made by Unilot acting in its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Unilot Platform, to create and issue more UNIT Tokens, or to sell or liquidate Unilot. These decisions could adversely affect the Unilot Platform and/or the UNIT Tokens you hold.

17. Risks arising from the online gaming industry: the online gaming industry, and by extension the Unilot Platform, are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to gambling, intellectual property, employment, KYC/AML and customer due diligence procedures, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, data security, and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the Unilot Platform could be enacted, which could impact the utility of UNIT Tokens in the Unilot Platform. Additionally, the Unilot Platform users may be subject to or adversely affected by industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fail to comply with any such licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise extended, it could adversely impact the Unilot Platform and the UNIT Tokens, including its functionality to obtain or provide services within the Unilot Platform.

18. Risks associated with the development and maintenance of the Unilot Platform: the Unilot Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for the UNIT Tokens and Unilot Platform to function as described in Schedule 1 and the Unilot Whitepaper, and we intend to take commercially reasonable steps towards those ends, we may have to make changes to the specifications of the UNIT Tokens or the Unilot Platform for any number of legitimate reasons. This could create the risk that UNIT Tokens or the Unilot Platform, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchasing UNIT Tokens. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Unilot Platform, it is still possible that the Unilot Platform will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Unilot Platform and UNIT Tokens, and the potential utility of the UNIT Tokens.

19. Risk of Competing Platforms: It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the Unilot Platform and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the services offered by or within the Unilot Platform. The Unilot Platform may compete with these alternatives, which could negatively impact the Unilot Platform and UNIT Tokens, including the utility of the UNIT Tokens on the Unilot Platform.

20. Unanticipated Risks: cryptographic tokens such as UNIT Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set out in this Schedule 3, there are other risks associated with your acquisition, storage, transfer and use of UNIT Tokens, including those that Unilot may not be able to anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks set out in this Schedule 3.
