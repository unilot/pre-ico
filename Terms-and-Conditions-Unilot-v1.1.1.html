                tokens that are created based on the ERC20 token standard. Compatible wallets include: Metamask, MIST,
                or the Gnosis multi-sig wallet. UNIT Tokens will not be issued to any Purchaser sending ETH from an
                exchange. We reserve a right to prescribe additional conditions relating to the specific wallet
                requirements at any time, in our sole and absolute discretion. UNIT Tokens can be purchased solely by

            ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH UNILOT AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM

        <ol class="nested">
            <li>Binding Arbitration. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or
                proceedings (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) in which either Party seeks injunctive or other
                equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation,
                copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Unilot <b>(i)</b> waive
                your and Unilot’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these T&amp;Cs
                resolved in a court, and <b>(ii)</b> waive your and Unilot’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead,
                you and Unilot will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute
                to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination
                to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).
            </li>
            <li>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. Any Dispute arising out of or related to
                these T&amp;Cs is personal to you and Unilot and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration
                and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative
                proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve
                a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot
                be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration,
                or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.
            </li>
            <li>Arbitration Rules. The enforceability of this clause 20 will be both substantively and procedurally
                governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the rules of The International Centre for
                Dispute Resolution (“<strong>ICDR</strong>”) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
            </li>
            <li>Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute
                within thirty (30) days of the date it arises so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve
                such Dispute informally. Notice to Unilot shall be sent by e-mail to Unilot at <a
                        href="mailto:notices@unilot.io" target="_blank">notices@unilot.io</a>. Notice to you shall be
                sent to any address you provide to us in a written notice. Your notice must include <b>(i)</b> your
                name, postal address, email address and telephone number, <b>(ii)</b> a description in reasonable detail
                of the nature or basis of the Dispute and <b>(iii)</b> the specific relief that you are seeking. If you
                and Unilot cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date the notice is
                received by the applicable Party, then either you or Unilot may, as appropriate and in accordance with
                this clause 20, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in clause
                20.1, file a claim in court.
            </li>
            <li>Process. Any arbitration will occur in Malta. The arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a
                single arbitrator appointed by the ICDR in accordance with the rules of the ICDR, which are hereby
                incorporated by reference. The courts located in Malta will have exclusive jurisdiction over any
                permissible court proceedings, which are intended to include only appeals and the enforcement of an
                arbitration decision.
            </li>
            <li>Authority of Arbitrator. These T&amp;Cs, the applicable ICDR rules and the arbitrator will have:
                <b>(i)</b> the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions
                regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and <b>(ii)</b> the
                authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, provided, however, that the
                arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative or class
                action, which is prohibited by these T&amp;Cs. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration
                and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or
                representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
            </li>
            <li>Arbitration Rules. The rules of the ICDR and additional information about The International Centre for

                By agreeing to be bound by these T&amp;Cs, you either <b>(i)</b> acknowledge and agree that you have
                read and understand the ICDR rules, or <b>(ii)</b> waive your opportunity to read the ICDR rules and any
                claim that the ICDR are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

            <li>Severability of Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provisions. If any term, clause or provision of this
                clause 20 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent applicable and
                required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this clause 20 will remain valid and
                enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in clause 20.2 above are severable from the other provisions
                of these T&amp;Cs and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.

        <h3 id="schedule3">SCHEDULE 3</h3>
        <h4>RISK FACTORS</h4>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>Risk of software weaknesses: because UNIT Tokens, the Smart Contract System and the Unilot Platform are
                based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may
                have a material adverse effect on UNIT Tokens, the Smart Contract System and/or the Unilot Platform.
                Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing,
                could present risks to the UNIT Tokens, the Smart Contract System and/or the Unilot Platform, by
                rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol. The
                Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the
                Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven. There is no warranty or
                assurance that the process for creating UNIT Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an
                inherent risk that the software could contain defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, viruses or bugs
                causing, inter alia, the complete loss of contributions and/or UNIT Tokens.
            </li>
            <li>Regulatory risk: blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain
                jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain
                technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Smart Contract System
                and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications to the Smart Contract System and/or the
                Unilot Platform, including its termination and the loss of UNIT Tokens for the Purchaser. Additionally,
                regulation of proposed activities of the Unilot Platform is currently uncertain. It is not known what
                regulatory framework the proposed Unilot Platform and associated activities will be subject to, the
                nature of the obligations that will be imposed on Unilot in order to comply with any such regulatory
                framework or when or if Unilot will even be able to apply to be regulated, or successfully obtain the
                necessary licences so that it may lawfully carry out its proposed business activities in all relevant
                jurisdictions.
            </li>
            <li>Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions: the regulatory status of UNIT
                Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult
                to predict how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such
                technology and its applications, including the Unilot Platform and UNIT Tokens. It is likewise difficult
                to predict how or whether any legislative or regulatory authorities may implement changes to law and
                regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Unilot Platform
                and UNIT Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Unilot Platform and UNIT Tokens in
                various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that UNIT Tokens are
                a regulated financial instrument that requires registration or licensing. Unilot may cease operations in
                a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to
                operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s)
                to operate in such jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li>Risk of abandonment / lack of success: the creation and issue of UNIT Tokens and the development of the
                Unilot Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public,
                lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). There is
                no assurance that, even if the Unilot Platform is partially or fully developed and launched, you will
                receive any benefits through UNIT Tokens that you hold.
            </li>
            <li>Risk associated with other applications: the Unilot Platform may give rise to other, alternative
                projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which UNIT Tokens will likely not be usable.
            </li>
            <li>Risks associated with markets for UNIT Tokens: We do not enable or otherwise facilitate any secondary
                trading or external valuation of UNIT Tokens. This may restrict the contemplated avenues for using UNIT
                Tokens, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to any UNIT Tokens you own. Even if
                secondary trading of UNIT Tokens is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges may be
                relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud
                or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that any third party ascribes an external exchange value to
                UNIT Tokens (e.g. as denominated in a crypto or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and
                diminish to zero. If you are purchasing UNIT Tokens as a form of investment on a speculative basis or
                otherwise, or for a financial purpose, with the expectation or desire that their inherent, intrinsic or
                cash-equivalent value may increase with time, you assume all risks associated with such speculation or
                actions, and any errors associated therewith, and accept that UNIT Tokens are not offered by Unilot or
                our affiliates on an investment basis. You further acknowledge that any contribution that you make under
                these T&amp;Cs will not be protected, guaranteed or reimbursed by any governmental, regulatory or other
                entity, and will not, for instance be guaranteed by the Malta Deposit Guarantee Scheme, the Malta
                Investor Compensation Scheme, and is unlikely to be protected by any equivalent scheme in a jurisdiction
                outside of Malta.
            </li>
            <li>Risk of losing access to tokens due to loss of private key(s), custodial error or your error: UNIT
                Tokens can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet with a combination of the Purchaser’s account
                information (address), private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. You
                acknowledge, understand and accept that if your private key or password gets lost or stolen, the
                obtained UNIT Tokens associated with your Ethereum wallet address may be unrecoverable and permanently
                lost. Additionally, any third party that gains access to your private key, including by gaining access
                to the login credentials relating to your Ethereum wallet, may be able to misappropriate your UNIT
                Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault in
                which you choose to receive and store UNIT Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or
                use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your UNIT Tokens.
            </li>
            <li>Risk of theft: the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software
                platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals
                including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks,
                Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Any such successful attacks could result in theft or loss of
                contributions or UNIT Tokens, adversely impacting the ability to develop the Unilot Platform and derive
                any usage or functionality from UNIT Tokens. Furthermore, because the Unilot Platform is based on
                open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Unilot team may
                intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or defects into the core infrastructure of the
                Unilot Platform, which could negatively affect the Unilot Platform and UNIT Tokens.
            </li>
            <li>Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart
                Contract System is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks,
                majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and rare condition attacks. Any successful
                attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract System, expected proper execution and sequencing of token
                transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. You understand and
                accept that the network of miners will ultimately be in control of the delivery of the UNIT Tokens via
                the Smart Contract System, and that a majority of miners could agree at any point to make changes,
                updates, modifications to, or effect a deletion or destruction of the Smart Contract System, and that
                such a scenario could lead to the UNIT Tokens losing intrinsic value and/or functionality.
            </li>
            <li>Risk of incompatible wallet service: the wallet or wallet service provider used to receive UNIT Tokens
                must conform to the ERC20 token standard in order to be technically compatible with UNIT Tokens. The
                failure to ensure such conformity may have the result that Purchaser will not gain access to his UNIT
                Tokens.
            </li>
            <li>Risk of hard-fork: the Unilot Platform will need to go through substantial development works as part of
                which it may become the subject of significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before
                release. As part of the development, an upgrade to UNIT Tokens may be required (hard-fork of UNIT
                Tokens) and that, if you decide not to participate in such upgrade, you may no longer be able to use
                your UNIT Tokens and any non-upgraded UNIT Tokens may lose all or part of their functionality.
            </li>
            <li>Risk of uninsured losses: unlike bank accounts or accounts at other financial institutions, UNIT Tokens
                are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of
                loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us to offer
                recourse to you.
            </li>
            <li>Risks arising from taxation: the tax characterization of UNIT Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your
                own tax advice in connection with acquisition, storage, transfer and use of UNIT Tokens, which may
                result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer
                taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax
                reporting requirements.
            </li>
            <li>Risk of an unfavourable fluctuation of Ethereum and other currency value: Unilot intends to use the
                contributions received to fund the development of the Unilot Platform and various other operating
                expenses. The contributions received will be denominated in ETH, and may be converted into other
                cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of ETH or other such currencies fluctuate unfavourably
                during or after the Purchase Period, Unilot may not be able to fund the development of, or may not be
                able to maintain, the Unilot Platform in the manner that it intended, in which case the UNIT Tokens may
                lose all or part of their value.
            </li>
            <li>Risk of dissolution of the Company or network: it is possible that, due to any number of reasons,
                including, but not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of ETH (or other cryptographic
                and fiat currencies), decrease in UNIT Tokens utility due to negative adoption of the Unilot Platform,
                the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Unilot
                Platform may no longer be viable to operate and Unilot may dissolve.
            </li>
            <li>Risks arising from lack of governance rights: because UNIT Tokens confer no governance rights of any
                kind with respect to the Unilot Platform or Unilot, all decisions involving the Unilot Platform or
                Unilot will be made by Unilot acting in its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to,
                decisions to discontinue the Unilot Platform, to create and issue more UNIT Tokens, or to sell or
                liquidate Unilot. These decisions could adversely affect the Unilot Platform and/or the UNIT Tokens you
                hold.
            </li>
            <li>Risks arising from the online gaming industry: the online gaming industry, and by extension the Unilot
                Platform, are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including
                those with respect to gambling, intellectual property, employment and customer due diligence
                procedures, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, data security, and others. These laws and
                regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In
                addition, new laws or regulations affecting the Unilot Platform could be enacted, which could impact the
                utility of UNIT Tokens in the Unilot Platform. Additionally, the Unilot Platform users may be subject to
                or adversely affected by industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of
                these parties fail to comply with any such licensing requirements or other applicable laws or
                regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are
                otherwise extended, it could adversely impact the Unilot Platform and the UNIT Tokens, including its
                functionality to obtain or provide services within the Unilot Platform.
            </li>
            <li>Risks associated with the development and maintenance of the Unilot Platform: the Unilot Platform is
                still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for the UNIT
                Tokens and Unilot Platform to function as described in Schedule 1 and the Unilot White Paper, and we
                intend to take commercially reasonable steps towards those ends, we may have to make changes to the
                specifications of the UNIT Tokens or the Unilot Platform for any number of legitimate reasons. This
                could create the risk that UNIT Tokens or the Unilot Platform, as further developed and maintained, may
                not meet your expectations at the time of purchasing UNIT Tokens. Furthermore, despite our good faith
                efforts to develop and maintain the Unilot Platform, it is still possible that the Unilot Platform will
                experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively
                impact the Unilot Platform and UNIT Tokens, and the potential utility of the UNIT Tokens.
            </li>
            <li>Risk of Competing Platforms: It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize
                the same open source code and protocol underlying the Unilot Platform and attempt to facilitate services
                that are materially similar to the services offered by or within the Unilot Platform. The Unilot
                Platform may compete with these alternatives, which could negatively impact the Unilot Platform and UNIT
                Tokens, including the utility of the UNIT Tokens on the Unilot Platform.
            </li>
            <li>Unanticipated Risks: cryptographic tokens such as UNIT Tokens are a new and untested technology. In
                addition to the risks set out in this Schedule 3, there are other risks associated with your
                acquisition, storage, transfer and use of UNIT Tokens, including those that Unilot may not be able to
                anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks
                set out in this Schedule 3.
