<p class="c0"><span class="c1">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CLAUSE CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS CERTAIN PROVISIONS, SUCH AS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS CLAUSE REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH UNILOT AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">19.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binding Arbitration. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, &ldquo;</span><span

Instead, you and Unilot will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">19.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. Any Dispute arising out of or related to these T&amp;Cs is personal to you and Unilot and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">19.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration Rules.

</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">19.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve such Dispute informally. Notice to Unilot shall be sent by e-mail to Unilot at notices@url. Notice to you shall be sent to any address you provide to us in a written notice. Your notice must include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute and (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Unilot cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date the notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or Unilot may, as appropriate and in accordance with this clause 19, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in clause 19.1, file a claim in court.</span>

The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual&rsquo;s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</span>

The Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven. There is no warranty or assurance that the process for creating </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, viruses or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of contributions and/or </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory risk: blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Smart Contract System and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications to the Smart Contract System and/or the Unilot Platform, including its termination and the loss of </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for the Purchaser. Additionally, regulation of proposed activities of the Unilot Platform is currently uncertain. It is not known what regulatory framework the proposed Unilot Platform and associated activities will be subject to, the nature of the obligations that will be imposed on Unilot in order to comply with any such regulatory framework or when or if Unilot will even be able to apply to be regulated, or successfully obtain the necessary licences so that it may lawfully carry out its proposed business activities in all relevant jurisdictions. </span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions: the regulatory status of </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Unilot Platform and </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any legislative or regulatory authorities may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Unilot Platform and </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Unilot Platform and </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are a regulated financial instrument that requires registration or licensing. Unilot may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of abandonment / lack of success: the creation and issue of </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and the development of the Unilot Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). There is no assurance that, even if the Unilot Platform is partially or fully developed and launched, you will receive any benefits through </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that you hold.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk associated with other applications: the Unilot Platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will likely not be usable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span
        class="c1">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks associated with markets for </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">: We do not enable or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span
        class="c1">. This may restrict the contemplated avenues for using </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span
        class="c1">, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to any </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you own. Even if secondary trading of </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that any third party ascribes an external exchange value to </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(e.g. as denominated in a crypto or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. If you are purchasing </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as a form of investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, or for a financial purpose, with the expectation or desire that their inherent, intrinsic or cash-equivalent value may increase with time, you assume all risks associated with such speculation or actions, and any errors associated therewith, and accept that </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are not offered by Unilot or our affiliates on an investment basis. You further acknowledge that any contribution that you make under these T&amp;Cs will not be protected, guaranteed or reimbursed by any governmental, regulatory or other entity, and will not, for instance be guaranteed by the Malta Deposit Guarantee Scheme, the Malta Investor Compensation Scheme, and is unlikely to be protected by any equivalent scheme in a jurisdiction outside of Malta.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of losing access to tokens due to loss of private key(s), custodial error or your error: </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet with a combination of the Purchaser&rsquo;s account information (address), private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. You acknowledge, understand and accept that if your private key or password gets lost or stolen, the obtained </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;associated with your Ethereum wallet address may be unrecoverable and permanently lost. Additionally, any third party that gains access to your private key, including by gaining access to the login credentials relating to your Ethereum wallet, may be able to misappropriate your </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault in which you choose to receive and store </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of theft: the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Any such successful attacks could result in theft or loss of contributions or </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">, adversely impacting the ability to develop the Unilot Platform and derive any usage or functionality from </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">. Furthermore, because the Unilot Platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Unilot team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or defects into the core infrastructure of the Unilot Platform, which could negatively affect the Unilot Platform and </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart Contract System is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, &ldquo;selfish-mining&rdquo; attacks, and rare condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract System, expected proper execution and sequencing of token transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. You understand and accept that the network of miners will ultimately be in control of the delivery of the </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;via the Smart Contract System, and that a majority of miners could agree at any point to make changes, updates, modifications to, or effect a deletion or destruction of the Smart Contract System, and that such a scenario could lead to the </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;losing intrinsic value and/or functionality.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of incompatible wallet service: the wallet or wallet service provider used to receive </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;must conform to the ERC20 token standard in order to be technically compatible with </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">. The failure to ensure such conformity may have the result that Purchaser will not gain access to his </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of hard-fork: the Unilot Platform will need to go through substantial development works as part of which it may become the subject of significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. As part of the development, an upgrade to </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;may be required (hard-fork of </span><span class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span
        class="c1">) and that, if you decide not to participate in such upgrade, you may no longer be able to use your </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and any non-upgraded </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;may lose all or part of their functionality.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of uninsured losses: unlike bank accounts or accounts at other financial institutions, </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us to offer recourse to you.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks arising from taxation: the tax characterization of </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with acquisition, storage, transfer and use of </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of an unfavourable fluctuation of Ethereum and other currency value: Unilot intends to use the contributions received to fund the development of the Unilot Platform and various other operating expenses. The contributions received will be denominated in ETH, and may be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of ETH or other such currencies fluctuate unfavourably during or after the Purchase Period, Unilot may not be able to fund the development of, or may not be able to maintain, the Unilot Platform in the manner that it intended, in which case the </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;may lose all or part of their value.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of dissolution of the Company or network: it is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of ETH (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;utility due to negative adoption of the Unilot Platform, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Unilot Platform may no longer be viable to operate and Unilot may dissolve.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks arising from lack of governance rights: because </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Unilot Platform or Unilot, all decisions involving the Unilot Platform or Unilot will be made by Unilot acting in its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Unilot Platform, to create and issue more </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">, or to sell or liquidate Unilot. These decisions could adversely affect the Unilot Platform and/or the </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you hold.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks arising from the online gaming industry: the online gaming industry, and by extension the Unilot Platform, are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to gambling, intellectual property, employment, KYC/AML and customer due diligence procedures, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, data security, and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the Unilot Platform could be enacted, which could impact the utility of </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in the Unilot Platform. Additionally, the Unilot Platform users may be subject to or adversely affected by industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fail to comply with any such licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise extended, it could adversely impact the Unilot Platform and the </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">, including its functionality to obtain or provide services within the Unilot Platform.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks associated with the development and maintenance of the Unilot Platform: the Unilot Platform is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for the </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and Unilot Platform to function as described in Schedule 1 and the Unilot Whitepaper, and we intend to take commercially reasonable steps towards those ends, we may have to make changes to the specifications of the </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or the Unilot Platform for any number of legitimate reasons. This could create the risk that </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or the Unilot Platform, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchasing </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Unilot Platform, it is still possible that the Unilot Platform will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Unilot Platform and </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">, and the potential utility of the </span><span class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span
        class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of Competing Platforms: It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the Unilot Platform and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the services offered by or within the Unilot Platform. The Unilot Platform may compete with these alternatives, which could negatively impact the Unilot Platform and </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">, including the utility of the </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on the Unilot Platform.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unanticipated Risks: cryptographic tokens such as </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set out in this Schedule 3, there are other risks associated with your acquisition, storage, transfer and use of </span><span
        class="c5">UNIT Tokens</span><span class="c1">, including those that Unilot may not be able to anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks set out in this Schedule 3.</span>
