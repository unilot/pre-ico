                    <p>Unilot uses blockchain to run a decentralized universal gambling platform for
                        players to bet, host, and in future create their own games ranging from pure
                        chance lotteries, to poker tournaments, and prognostication-based totalizers.
                        We are working to make Unilot available on the Web, iOS and Android and in
                        multiple languages in addition to current English and Russian.</p>

                    <p>With online gambling market projected to reach nearly $60B by 2020, both the
                        quickly-evolving regulatory landscape and criminal practices turn away consumers
                        reducing their trust and peace of mind. Here at Unilot, we made it our strategic
                        priority to successfully tackle regulatory limitations that vary drastically from one
                        jurisdiction to another, and mitigate consumer mistrust.</p>
                    <p>To deal with regulations, games offered through Unilot will vary based on the player's
                        geographic location. We are building an intelligent system capable of detecting which
                        games to offer and which ones to lock. Furthermore, Unilot continues to secure
                        licenses in various jurisdictions to expand its user-base.</p>
                    <p>Unilot leverages decentralized gaming on blockchain to effectively address consumer
                        mistrust, featuring some core fair-play fundamentals:</p>

                    <p>Online gambling industry has been plagued by inability to tackle high tech
                        cheating and lack of transparency. To name a few, 2008 and 2011 online poker
                        scandals led to online gambling bans in some countries.</p>
                    <p>Though it was off to a rocky start, online gambling is well poised to become the
                        gambling industry’s fastest-growing sector, and accounts for 11% of the $385B
                        of gambling profits posted in 2016. These numbers are only set to grow as reg-
                        ulations worldwide are loosening their stance toward online betting.</p>
                    <p>According to H2 Gambling Capital, total revenues in 2016 from online gambling
                        posted staggering $44B with online betting responsible for nearly a half of the
                        total amount. Market projections show this number to grow to $47.4 Billion
                        USD in 2017 and over $60 billion by 2020.</p>

                    <p>Unilot is designed with a product diversity in mind. Its platform will feature a
                        broad range of gambling venues from specific games to prognostication-based
                        betting in compliance with specific jurisdiction regulations on games and cur-

                                Hosting functionality is what makes

                                peer-betting venues.
                                Currently, players can host any of the
                                available global games, like running

                                oracles, Unilot players should be able
                                to create their own betting pools and
                                totalizers.</p>

                    <h3>Primary Revenue Generation Model</h3>
                    <p>For all available global games, Unilot retains a tiny fraction of game winnings
                        and game antes where games have an an ante or entry fee. Unilot also retains
                        a small percentage every time Unilots are exchanged; those proceeds are then
                        distributed among Unilot token holders based on proof-of-stake mechanism.</p>
                    <p>For hosted games and white label games Unilot collects a setup fee or offers
                        service level agreement to larger hosts. In certain instances, owners of hosted
                        games and white label companies (the originators) when spinning off their own
                        games may want to have Unilot owners (the backers) auction, loan, or put forth
                        their own Unilots to fully or partially fund those hosted games. In exchange,
                        the backers may receive additional revenues or incentives from the originators
                        even if the backers don’t end up playing that particular game.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of the arrangement, the fees Unilot retains in global games or as
                        part of setup fees in white label and hosted games are seamless, transparent
                        and not interrupting to the gaming process.</p>
                    <h3>Secondary Revenue Generation Models</h3>
                    <p><strong>Advertising Revenues</strong><br/>
                        To recognize and incentivize random or most valued players, Unilot intends to
                        raffle tokens as well as physical prizes. Unilot is actively building partnerships
                        with advertisers interested in promoting products, brands, and causes through
                        product placements. Unilot aims to market product placement opportunities
                        and calculate advertising fees based on the audience’s geographic and demo-
                        graphic parameters.</p>
                    <p>Faithful to its mission to further fairness and common benefit, Unilot intends
                        to not only run commercial product placements, but also provide a centerstage
                        for philanthropic causes, including fundraisers for meaningful social causes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Affiliate Marketing</strong><br/>
                        Like any platform that benefits from active market participation, Unilot has ac-
                        tive plans to implement traditional affiliate marketing programs. Those would
                        include incentivising and rewarding referrals, reviews offered by content provid-
                        ers, and introduction of miscellaneous individual and institutional investment
                        prospects.</p>
                    <p><strong>Additional Merchandising</strong><br/>
                        Unilot recognizes the value and opportunity of engaging global audiences and
                        making play easy and fun. Being able to accept conventional currencies is a
                        major part of this solution, as many people worldwide are still poorly familiar
                        with concept of cryptocurrencies. Aiming to encourage the use of its platform
                        for individual betting and create a strong global and diverse presence, Unilot
                        currently develops the feature that allows accepting funds in local currencies
                        placed on physical and digital gift cards. Such gift cards can be sold through-
                        out small retail places and used by their recipients as conventional lottery
                        tickets.</p>

                    <p><strong>Smart Contracts</strong><br/>
                        Use of smart contracts on Ethereum network significantly simplifies running
                        the games, their integrity, and inviolability of their outcome. Some basic exam-
                        ples of those Smart Contracts can run ladders in tournaments or sets of indi-
                        vidual table rules like seat assignments, escrowing funds, and distribution of
                        payouts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Identity Management</strong><br/>
                        Through its smart geosensing and public anonymity achievable on blockchain,
                        Unilot provides an intelligent solution to the dilemma of user privacy and legali-
                        ty in user identity management.</p>
                    <p>Part of our commitment to providing quality gaming network, includes embed-
                        ding of solutions like uPort or similar options as they become available. We
                        very well know that a good game should not be interrupted by bots, fake ac-
                        counts, and other unwanted spam. Therefore security and great uninterrupted
                        experience are on the top of our priority list.</p>
                    <p><strong>Gameplay Consensus, Client Synchronization, and Log Storage</strong><br/>
                        Unilot uses Mental Poker algorithm that produces a consensus through a Byz-
                        antine Fault Tolerant Consensus Mechanism for games that require shuffling.
                        Simultaneously, peer-to-peer messaging ensures game’s critical-and-sufficient
                        synchronization across multiple mobile clients. For all in-game activity, Unilot
                        runs a time-series log stored on IPFS for both compliance and technical pur-
                        poses.</p>

                        Truthful to our mission, we design Unilot to become a truly global gambling
                        and betting platform transcending geographic and demographic barriers to
                        cater a unique personalized experience to every player. The use of Ethereum
                        network and smart contracts yields a transparent record of game results data,
                        which we deliberately keep open for public to review and analyze.</p>
                    <p>Parallel to data produced on main stack, we are also building Unilot Artificial

                        a Mental Poker protocol for cards shuffling. Unilot mobile client also runs a so-
                        called light wallet to facilitate escrow, ensure instant payout on winnings, and
                        keep game ante and wins separate from player’s stash. In subsequent releases,
                        light wallet would also offer instant conversion feature to other cryptocurren-

                    <p class="lead">Dear Gamers, Dear Investors,</p>
                    <p>Unilot appeared as a unique amalgam of bold vision, revolutionary ideas, social experiment, and
                        elegant
                        application of cutting edge technology. Unilot is driven by an important social mission in its
                        core: to
                        build the world's most transparent, secure, and diverse betting platform. Made possible by the
                        advent of
                        Blockchain, Unilot launches a truly universal arena to gambling, betting, and prognostication.
                        It is
                        there to leverage the players' abilities and creativity while providing the atmosphere of safety
                        and
                        integrity far beyond those found in modern gambling.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the house does not always have to win. That is why in Unilot, we decided not to
                        have a
                        House for our players to compete against. We believe that math doesn't lie and can make cheating
                        impossible. That is why we offer our players a pure chance to wager against each other's odds,
                        We
                        believe that sharing is truly caring. Thus we offer freedom of choice and multiple second
                        chances and
                        consolation rounds to all members of our community. While we believe in respecting the laws of
                        the land,
                        we also believe in people's fundamental right to make their own judgement when to try their luck
                        as well
                        as enjoy the opportunity to create their own rules when making a bet.</p>
                    <p>Unilot may seem like a magical little playground that resides on your phone or computer screen,
                        but it
                        opens a door to the place, where the whole world comes together for a fun and engaging
                        experience with
                        odds never rigged unless they are occasionally stacked into players' favor. </p>
                    <p>We pledge to review any community's feedback and keep the records open for anyone to audit
                        building trust
                        and openness standards like never before. </p>

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Unilot uses blockchain to run a decentralized universal gambling platform for players to bet,
                        host, and
                        in future create their own games ranging from pure chance lotteries, to poker tournaments, and
                        prognostication-based totalizers. We are working to make Unilot available on the Web, iOS and
                        Android
                        and in multiple languages in addition to current English and Russian. </p>
                    <p>To facilitate the exchange, Unilot platform transacts in its own currency "Unilots" while
                        accepting most
                        cryptocurrencies and other legal means of tender in appropriate jurisdictions. The purpose of
                        this White
                        Paper is to demonstrate Unilot's technology and solutions it offers, as well as demonstrate the
                        mature
                        business expertise behind the founding team's vision.</p>

                        both the
                        quickly-evolving regulatory landscape and criminal practices turn away consumers reducing their
                        trust
                        and peace of mind. Here at Unilot, we made it our strategic priority to successfully tackle
                        regulatory
                        limitations that vary drastically from one jurisdiction to another, and mitigate consumer
                        mistrust.</p>
                    <p>To deal with regulations, games offered through Unilot will vary based on the player's geographic
                        location. We are building an intelligent system capable of detecting which games to offer and
                        which ones
                        to lock. Furthermore, Unilot continues to secure licenses in various jurisdictions to expand its
                        user-base.</p>

                    <p>Online gambling industry has been plagued by inability to tackle high tech cheating and lack of
                        transparency. To name a few, 2008 and 2011 online poker scandals led to online gambling bans in
                        some
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Though it was off to a rocky start, online gambling is well poised to become the gambling
                        industry's
                        fastest-growing sector, and accounts for 11% of the $385B of gambling profits posted in 2016.
                        These
                        numbers are only set to grow as regulations worldwide are loosening their stance toward online
                        betting. </p>

                        $44B with

                    <h2>3. Product Details</h2>
                    <p>Unilot is a decentralized gaming platform with focus on transparency and security. Unilot client
                        runs iOS
                        and Android mobile apps offered through multiple languages (starting with English, Chinese,
                        Russian
                        etc)</p>
                    <p>After Unilot's launch, players should expect the following games:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Casino</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="s31-features">Unilot Features &amp; Benefits</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Elimination of deposit risk: player retains a full custody over their funds until the game
                            outcome.
                            Instead of landing into any of Unilot-controlled accounts, the funds are directed into an
                            independent Escrow on Smart Contract that distributes the proceeds according to game rules
                            and
                            outcomes
                        </li>
                        <li>Gameplay fairness and transparency is achieved with having all players at table reaching a
                            consensus
                            done on blockchain network. Actions like card shuffling occur with all the players involved.
                            Game
                            play is recorded on blockchain ledger ensuring an unparalleled integrity.
                        </li>
                        <li>Since the games run on peer-to-peer blockchain and smart contracts, Unilot completely
                            eliminates any
                            access to individual player's cards. Players' cards are only visible to the players
                            themselves.
                        </li>
                        <li>Unilot is all about a more balanced and fair gambling network. Using Ethereum network and
                            Ethereum
                            smart contracts eliminates costly server hosting fees and disputes arising from handling
                            players'
                            funds. The savings are passed on to the players.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="s32-games">Unilot Games</h3>
                    <p>Unilot mobile client features two modes available to players: Global &amp; Hosted Games.</p>

                    <h4 id="s321-global">Global Games</h4>
                    <p>All global games offered are open to anyone on Unilot platform meeting individual local
                        jurisdiction
                        requirements. Games will include minimum pot size before game starts, multiple or single winner
                        settings.</p>

                    <h4 id="s322-hosted">Hosted Games</h4>
                    <p>In line with Unilot's mission, hosting games will allow players to generate their own income by
                        hosting
                        their own games on Unilot platform. Players may set their minimum ante, game type and invite
                        others to
                        participate. Games are by invite-only and otherwise remain invisible to global community.</p>
                    <p>Hosting functionality is what makes Unilot truly stand out from most online lotteries by creating
                        a
                        comprehensive platform for current and future peer-betting venues. Currently, players can host
                        any of
                        the available global games, like running their own poker tournament, setting out their own
                        rules,
                        minimum pot size, their own "host's cut". In the near future, using smart contracts and oracles,
                        Unilot
                        players should be able to create their own betting pools and totalizers.</p>

                    <h2>4. Unilot Business Model</h2>
                    <h3 id="s41-primary">Primary Revenue Generation Model</h3>
                    <p>For all available global games, Unilot retains a tiny fraction of game winnings and game antes
                        where
                        games have an an ante or entry fee. Unilot also retains a small percentage every time Unilots
                        are
                        exchanged; those proceeds are then distributed among Unilot token holders based on
                        proof-of-stake
                        mechanism.</p>
                    <p>For hosted games and white label games Unilot collects a setup fee or offers service level
                        agreement to
                        larger hosts. In certain instances, owners of hosted games and white label companies (the
                        originators)
                        when spinning off their own games may want to have Unilot owners (the backers) auction, loan, or
                        put
                        forth their own Unilots to fully or partially fund those hosted games. In exchange, the backers
                        may
                        receive additional revenues or incentives from the originators even if the backers don't end up
                        playing
                        that particular game.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of the arrangement, the fees Unilot retains in global games or as part of setup fees
                        in white
                        label and hosted games are seamless, transparent and not interrupting to the gaming process.</p>

                    <h3 id="s42-secondary">Secondary Revenue Generation Models</h3>
                    <h4 id="s421-ads">Advertising Revenues</h4>
                    <p>To recognize and incentivize random or most valued players, Unilot intends to raffle tokens as
                        well as
                        physical prizes. Unilot is actively building partnerships with advertisers interested in
                        promoting
                        products, brands, and causes through product placements. Unilot aims to market product placement
                        opportunities and calculate advertising fees based on the audience's geographic and demographic
                        parameters. </p>
                    <p>Faithful to its mission to further fairness and common benefit, Unilot intends to not only run
                        commercial
                        product placements, but also provide a centerstage for philanthropic causes, including
                        fundraisers for
                        meaningful social causes.</p>

                    <h4 id="s422-affiliate">Affiliate Marketing</h4>
                    <p>Like any platform that benefits from active market participation, Unilot has active plans to
                        implement
                        traditional affiliate marketing programs. Those would include incentivising and rewarding
                        referrals,
                        reviews offered by content providers, and introduction of miscellaneous individual and
                        institutional
                        investment prospects. </p>

                    <h4 id="s423-merch">Additional Merchandising</h4>
                    <p>Unilot recognizes the value and opportunity of engaging global audiences and making play easy and
                        fun.
                        Being able to accept conventional currencies is a major part of this solution, as many people
                        worldwide
                        are still poorly familiar with concept of cryptocurrencies. Aiming to encourage the use of its
                        platform
                        for individual betting and create a strong global and diverse presence, Unilot currently
                        develops the
                        feature that allows accepting funds in local currencies placed on physical and digital gift
                        cards. Such
                        gift cards can be sold throughout small retail places and used by their recipients as
                        conventional
                        lottery tickets.</p>

                        tournaments or sets of individual table rules like seat assignments, escrowing funds, and

                    <h4 id="s512-id-management">Identity Management</h4>
                    <p>Through its smart geosensing and <em>public anonymity</em> achievable on blockchain, Unilot
                        provides an
                        intelligent solution to the dilemma of user privacy and legality in user identity management.
                    </p>
                    <p>Part of our commitment to providing quality gaming network, includes embedding of solutions like
                        uPort<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> or similar options as they become available. We
                        very well
                        know that a good game should not be interrupted by bots, fake accounts, and other unwanted spam.
                        Therefore security and great uninterrupted experience are on the top of our priority list.</p>

                    <h4 id="s513">Gameplay Consensus, Client Synchronization, and Log Storage</h4>
                    <p>Unilot uses Mental Poker algorithm that produces a consensus through a Byzantine Fault Tolerant
                        Consensus
                        Mechanism for games that require shuffling. Simultaneously, peer-to-peer messaging ensures
                        game's <em>critical-and-sufficient</em>
                        synchronization across multiple mobile clients. For all in-game activity, Unilot runs a
                        time-series log
                        stored on IPFS for both compliance and technical purposes.</p>

                    <h3 id="s52-suite">Unilot Business Intelligence Suite</h3>
                    <p>Truthful to our mission, we design Unilot to become a truly global gambling and betting platform
                        transcending geographic and demographic barriers to cater a unique personalized experience to
                        every
                        player. The use of Ethereum network and smart contracts yields a transparent record of game
                        results
                        data, which we deliberately keep open for public to review and analyze.</p>
                    <p>Parallel to data produced on main stack, we are also building Unilot Artificial Intelligence
                        solution to
                        observe systems performance and improve user experience. AI's mission is to help users feel
                        informed and
                        empowered with best relevant data, like gaming odds, curated interpretation of gaming trends, or
                        provide
                        assistant functions to UI.</p>

                    <p>All Unilot global or hosted games can be run on Unilot mobile client, specifically designed to
                        handle all
                        components of peer-to-peer communication from initiating and joining games to performing the
                        required
                        blockchain actions, like using a Mental Poker protocol for cards shuffling. Unilot mobile client
                        also
                        runs a so-called light wallet to facilitate escrow, ensure instant payout on winnings, and keep
                        game
                        ante and wins separate from player's stash. In subsequent releases, light wallet would also
                        offer
                        instant conversion feature to other cryptocurrencies from Unilots.</p>
                    <p>Currently, the mobile client is built for iOS and Android only, and offers smart region selection
                        and
                        localization.</p>
